                What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?

                <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite
                  are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is
                  a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on
                  smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers
                  sections of pages.

                  However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite
                  Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason
                  stopping you from using the best of two worlds.

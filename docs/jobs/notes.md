1. What was the inspiration and goals behind starting this project?
	- During my time at The Virtual Wild we had a challenge I have seen time and time again which is that small to medium sized startups need to be able to move fast, be flexible, onboard rapidly, and often hire predominately juniors. This is a recipe for disaster if you don't have a strong technical leader who can set the tone and direction for the team. I wanted to create a resource that would help fill that gap and provide a solid foundation for new engineers to build on. Tailwind is an architure I devised that consists of modules. A module has a public folder and a private folder, each with their own assembly and namespace modulename.public and modulename.private. The public folder contains the API/Interface and any custom datatypes used therein, and the private folder contains the implementation. This allows you to create a module that can be consumed by other modules without exposing the implementation details. This is a powerful pattern that allows you to create a modular architecture that is easy to reason about and easy to extend. I treat each module as its own mini Unity project, so it has its own folder structure, its own assembly definitions, and its own namespace. This allows you to easily move modules between projects and even share them between projects. I have found this to be a very powerful pattern that allows you to create a modular architecture that is easy to reason about and easy to extend.

I have found this to be a very powerful pattern that allows you to create a modular architecture that is easy to reason about and easy to extend. I later realised it's similar to working with c++ in that you could think of the public folder as a header.
2. What key technologies or frameworks are you utilizing for it?
   - C# and Unity, but really it was about the architecture and design patterns.
3. What motivated your choice of tech stack?
   - Well it was a very Unity focused thing, but the architecture is applicable to any language or framework and I am currently using it in the Neurocache API python codebase.
4. What problem does Tailwind Mechanics aim to solve?
   - It solves multiple problems; onboarding is rapid as you don't onboard to a Untity project you onboard into a module. Jr devs can be leveraged as they can do little harm once scoped inside of a module. Modules can be reused so the studio can think of their suite of modules as one giant codebase, and the products they build as just a collection of modules. This allows you to build up a library of modules that can be reused across projects. It also allows you to share modules between projects, so if you have a module that is used in multiple projects you can make changes to it in one place and have those changes reflected in all projects that use it. This is a huge time saver and allows you to make sweeping changes to your codebase with confidence. 
5. Who is the target audience or customer for this project?
   - Small to medium sized game studios.
6. What stage is the project currently at - proof of concept, MVP, prototyping?
	- It's complete, I have used it in production a few times now and it has proven to be a very powerful pattern.
7. Have you shared or launched any aspect of Tailwind publicly yet?
	- Yes through my day jobs, but it is not a commercial project, more of a pattern or architecture.
8. What major milestones or accomplishments have you achieved so far?
	- Buy in and onboarding has been a breeze due to the 1-to-1 mapping  between folder structure, file location, namespaces, and assemblies. It's also very easy to extend and add new modules.
9.  What skills have you developed or improved by working on this?
	- I have become a better architect and have learned a lot about design patterns and how to apply them to Unity. Especially in the context taking into account potential future developers of all skill levels.
10. Why does this project excite you and what do you hope to learn or gain from it?
	- It's so easy and immediate to get right, and can be used in a hybrid way as every module comes complete with its own facade, so it excites me just because of how deeply satisfying it is.











1. How large have the codebases been that utilized Tailwind, in terms of lines of code or number of modules? This helps quantify the scale.
	- It would be pretty typical to have 20-50 modules, I don't recall seeing more than that.
2. Have you observed any measurable improvements in productivity, release velocity, or defect rates when using Tailwind? Any metrics help showcase impact.
	- Yes, it's very easy to onboard and get up to speed, and it's very easy to extend and add new modules. But no I know you're looking for production day job examples and I don't have any concrete. As I said it was a personal project and it will go on my Linkedin in a small personal projects section.
3. Is Tailwind applicable for large enterprise projects or optimized for certain team sizes or project scopes? Helps understand best use cases.
	- It is yes but you would need a large multidisciplinary team to get the most out of it. As your security, infra, and devops teams would need to be on board with it. It's not a silver bullet, it's just a pattern that I have found to be very powerful.
4. What opportunities exist to expand Tailwind, like adding template modules or more examples? Shows potential growth.
	- I have never gotten any of my employers to succesfully adopt it, but I have used hybrid versions of it in production and they have been robust and reused between projects. But I don't keep code I write fresh every time for my personal projects as I'm typically learning something and reps matter.
5. What benefits have team members or stakeholders highlighted after being introduced to Tailwind? Feedback can demonstrate value.
	- It's just extremely easy to reason about really and everyone says as much. No diagram is needed. Also it is a project structure system too it was as much about asset management as code management. So it benefits all disciplines working within Unity.














Tailwind Architecture

Developed an original architectural framework for structuring Unity projects in a modular way to improve development velocity.

The approach segregates features into distinct modules containing both a public API and private implementation. This encapsulation facilitates rapid onboarding, parallel development, reduces release defects, enables easier reasoning about complex projects, and facilitated code reuse across teams. 

Importantly this approach is as much about asset management as it is about code management. Each module is effectively a mini Unity project, so as a small to medium size studio you can think of your suite of modules as one giant codebase, and the products you build as just a collection of modules. This allows you to build up a library of modules that can be reused across projects. It also allows you to share modules between projects, so if you have a module that is used in multiple projects you can make changes to it in one place and have those changes reflected in all projects that use it. This is a huge time saver and allows you to make sweeping changes to your codebase with confidence.

Sure, let's imagine a bustling ancient city, a hub of commerce and knowledge, where information is the most valuable commodity. This city is your application.

In the heart of the city, there's a grand library, the Library of Supabase, where all the long-term knowledge (data) is stored. The librarians (Supabase APIs) are the keepers of this knowledge, and they are the only ones who can retrieve or modify the scrolls (data) stored within.

However, the city is vast, and not everyone can or should travel to the library every time they need information. That's where the Guild of React Query comes in. The guild members are couriers, skilled in the art of fetching scrolls from the library and bringing them to the citizens who need them. They also have a magical ability to create temporary copies (caches) of the scrolls they fetch. These copies disappear after a while, but while they exist, they can be used to answer queries quickly without needing to go back to the library.

The Guild of React Query is very efficient, but they only deal with information from the library. For other types of information, the citizens of the city rely on the Order of MobX. The Order is a group of scribes and messengers who keep track of all the local news and events (client-side state) happening in the city. They're constantly writing and updating their own set of scrolls (state objects), which can be about anything from the latest market prices to the schedule of the city's grand arena.

The Order of MobX and the Guild of React Query often work together. For example, a citizen might hire a guild member to fetch a scroll from the library, and then hire a member of the Order to spread the news about the information in the scroll.

In this city, communication is key. That's where the Whisperers of Socket.IO come in. They're a network of messengers who can deliver real-time updates across the city. When something important happens, the Whisperers can spread the news instantly, keeping everyone informed.

Finally, there's Axios, the city's master of logistics. Axios is responsible for organizing and managing all the requests going in and out of the city. Whether it's a guild member fetching a scroll from the library or a whisperer sending a message, Axios makes sure the request gets to where it needs to go.

In this city, every group has its role, and they all work together to keep the city running smoothly. Understanding how they interact and complement each other is the key to managing the city effectively.

That was fantastic thenk you, could you bullet point the key points for me to memorize in the context of the story please? I didn't realise Axios would be involved in the socket comms, which is great

I'm glad you enjoyed the story! Here are the key points to remember:

Supabase is like the grand library, storing all the long-term data. The Supabase APIs are the librarians who can retrieve or modify this data.

React Query is like the guild of couriers, fetching data from the library (Supabase) and creating temporary copies (caches) of it for quick access.

MobX is like the order of scribes and messengers, keeping track of all the local news and events (client-side state) happening in the city.

Socket.IO is like the network of whisperers, delivering real-time updates across the city.

Axios is like the city's master of logistics, managing all the requests going in and out of the city, including those made by React Query, MobX, and Socket.IO.

Remember, each of these technologies has its own role and they all work together to keep your application running smoothly. Understanding how they interact and complement each other is the key to managing your application effectively.

As for Axios and Socket.IO, while Axios is typically used for HTTP requests and Socket.IO for real-time WebSocket communication, they can indeed be used together in certain scenarios. For example, you might use Axios to make an initial HTTP request to establish a WebSocket connection via Socket.IO. However, once the WebSocket connection is established, the real-time communication would be handled by Socket.IO, not Axios.

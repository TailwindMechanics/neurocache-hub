1. ## Basic Chat Functionality:

      - Start by setting up the basic chat functionality without any caching or real-time updates. At this stage, every time a user sends a message or switches channels, you would fetch the entire chat history for that channel from the database.

      ### 1.1 Set up MobX

      - Install MobX in your project using pnpm add mobx mobx-react. Create a MobX store that will hold the state of your application. This might include the current user, the current channel, and the list of messages in the current channel.

      ### 1.2 Load Chat History:

      - When a user navigates to the chat page, your application should fetch the most recent X messages from the chat history for channel_test_01 from the database. This could be done, for example, by making a GET request to an API endpoint like /api/channels/channel_test_01/messages, which would return an array of message objects.

      ### 1.3 Display Chat History:

      - Once the chat history has been fetched, your application should loop through the array of message objects and display each message in the chat UI. Each message object might include properties like id, content, timestamp, and userId.

      ### 1.4 Send New Messages:

      - When a user types a message into the chat input and hits send, your application should make a POST request to an API endpoint like /api/channels/channel_test_01/messages, sending the new message as the request body. The server would then store the new message in the database and return the saved message object, including any properties that were automatically set by the database like id and timestamp.

      ### 1.5 Display New Messages:

      - Once the new message has been saved and returned by the server, your application should add the new message to the chat UI. This could be done by appending the new message object to the array of messages and re-rendering the chat UI.

      ### 1.6 Error Handling:

      - Throughout this process, your application should handle any errors that might occur, such as network errors or database errors. This could involve displaying an error message to the user, retrying the request, or some other appropriate response.
      - This basic chat functionality should provide a solid foundation for your chat application. Once this is working, you can start adding more advanced features like AI participants, real-time updates, and caching.

2. ## OpenAI Integration:
      - Once the basic chat functionality is working, you can integrate the OpenAI API to enable AI participants in the chat. At this stage, every time a user sends a message, you would also send it to the OpenAI API and then store the AI's response in the database and display it in the chat.
3. ## Real-Time Updates:
      - Next, you can add real-time updates using Socket.io. This would allow you to push new messages to all connected clients as soon as they are sent, without requiring the clients to refresh or fetch the entire chat history.
4. ## Caching with Redis:
      - Once real-time updates are working, you can add caching using Redis. This would allow you to store the chat history for each channel in memory for quick access, reducing the load on your database.
5. ## State Management with MobX and React Query:
      - Finally, you can add state management on the client side using MobX and React Query. This would allow you to cache recent messages in active channels on the client side, reducing the number of requests to your server.

## UserStore:

      - This store could manage the state related to the current user. This might include the user's ID, name, email, and any other relevant information. This store could also handle actions related to user authentication, such as logging in and logging out.

## AgentStore:

- This store could manage the state related to the AI agents. This might include a list of all agents, the current agent, and any other relevant information. This store could also handle actions related to agents, such as creating a new agent, training an agent, or deleting an agent.

## ChannelStore:

- This store could manage the state related to the chat channels. This might include a list of all channels, the current channel, and the chat history for each channel. This store could also handle actions related to channels, such as creating a new channel, switching channels, or deleting a channel.

## MessageStore:

- This store could manage the state related to the chat messages. This might include a list of all messages in the current channel, the current message, and any other relevant information. This store could also handle actions related to messages, such as sending a new message or deleting a message.

## DashboardStore:

- This store could manage the state related to the dashboard. This might include usage data, API keys, and any other relevant information. This store could also handle actions related to the dashboard, such as creating a new API key or updating the usage data.

- Each of these stores would be responsible for a specific part of your application's state, and they could reference each other if necessary. For example, the MessageStore might need to reference the UserStore to get the current user when sending a message, and the ChannelStore might need to reference the AgentStore to get the list of agents in a channel.

- Remember, the goal of structuring your state in this way is to make your code more modular and easier to manage. Each store should have a clear responsibility, and the state in each store should be closely related. If you find that a store is becoming too large or complex, it might be a sign that you need to split it into smaller stores.

1. ## Set up Redis

      - Install Redis on your machine or use a Redis cloud service. You'll use Redis to cache the channel history. Make sure to install the redis npm package in your project.

2. ## Set up MobX

      - Install MobX in your project using pnpm add mobx mobx-react. Create a MobX store that will hold the state of your application. This might include the current user, the current channel, and the list of messages in the current channel.

3. ## Set up React Query and Axios

      - Install React Query in your project using pnpm add react-query. You'll use React Query to fetch data from your backend and keep it in sync with your server state. Set up a query client and provide it at the top level of your application using the QueryClientProvider component.
      - Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node's http interface. Install it using pnpm add axios.

4. ## Test the data flow
      - Now that everything is set up, you can test the data flow in your application. Here's a basic example of how you might do this:
      - Use Axios to make a request to your backend to fetch the list of channels. Use React Query's useQuery hook to cache this data.
      - Display the list of channels in your UI. When a channel is clicked, update the currentChannel in your MobX store.
      - Use Axios and React Query to fetch the history of the current channel from your backend. The first time you fetch the history, it will come from Postgres. Store the history in the Redis cache.
      - The next time you fetch the history for the same channel, it should come from the Redis cache instead of Postgres. You can verify this by checking the speed of the request or by temporarily disconnecting your Postgres database.
      - Display the channel history in your UI. When a new message is sent, add it to the messages array in your MobX store and send it to your backend to be stored in Postgres.

## Cache Implementation

- Based on the latest information from various sources, here are the detailed steps for managing data flow within chat channels, with an emphasis on cache implementation, long-term storage management, and real-time updates.

### Using Redis for Caching Channel History

#### Set up Redis:

- If not already done, set up a Redis instance. This will be used to cache the chat history for each channel.

#### Cache messages on send:

- Whenever a message is sent in a channel, in addition to storing it in the Postgres database, also store it in the Redis cache. Use the channel ID as the key, and store the messages as a list or array associated with that key.

```typescript
const storeMessage = async (channelId: string, message: Message) => {
	// Store in Postgres
	await db.message.create({ data: message });

	// Store in Redis
	const redisKey = `channel:${channelId}:messages`;
	await redis.lpush(redisKey, JSON.stringify(message));
};
```

#### Retrieve messages from cache:

- When a user opens a channel, first try to retrieve the messages from the Redis cache. If the messages are not in the cache (for example, if the Redis instance was restarted), then fall back to retrieving the messages from the Postgres database.

```typescript
const getMessages = async (channelId: string) => {
	const redisKey = `channel:${channelId}:messages`;
	const messages = await redis.lrange(redisKey, 0, -1);

	if (messages.length > 0) {
		return messages.map((message) => JSON.parse(message));
	} else {
		// Fallback to Postgres
		return await db.message.findMany({ where: { channelId } });
	}
};
```

#### Evict old messages from cache:

- To prevent the Redis cache from growing indefinitely, regularly evict old messages from the cache. This could be done, for example, using a scheduled job that runs every hour and removes messages that are older than a certain threshold (e.g., 1 month).

```typescript
const evictOldMessages = async () => {
	const oneMonthAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30);

	const channels = await db.channel.findMany();
	for (const channel of channels) {
		const redisKey = `channel:${channel.id}:messages`;
		let messages = await redis.lrange(redisKey, 0, -1);
		messages = messages.map((message) => JSON.parse(message));

		const newMessages = messages.filter(
			(message) =>
				new Date(message.timestamp) >
				oneMonthAgo,
		);
		await redis.del(redisKey);
		for (const message of newMessages) {
			await redis.lpush(
				redisKey,
				JSON.stringify(message),
			);
		}
	}
};

// Schedule the job to run every hour
setInterval(evictOldMessages, 1000 * 60 * 60);
```

## Long-term Storage Management

### Using Postgres for Storing Chat History

#### Store messages:

- As mentioned above, whenever a message is sent in a channel, store it in the Postgres database.

#### Retrieve messages:

- When a user opens a channel and the messages are not in the Redis cache, retrieve the messages from the Postgres database.

#### Delete old messages:

- Regularly delete old messages from the database that are older than your retention period (e.g., 1 month). This could be done in the same scheduled job that evicts old messages from the Redis cache.

```typescript
const deleteOldMessages = async () => {
	const oneMonthAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30);

	await db.message.deleteMany({
		where: { timestamp: { lt: oneMonthAgo } },
	});
};

// Schedule the job to run every hour
setInterval(deleteOldMessages, 1000 * 60 * 60);
```

## Real-time Updates

### Using Socket.io for Real-time Updates

#### Set up Socket.io:

- If not already done, set up a Socket.io server. This will be used to push real-time updates to the clients.

#### Emit events on message send:

- Whenever a message is sent in a channel, emit a Socket.io event to all clients that are subscribed to that channel.

```typescript
const storeMessage = async (channelId: string, message: Message) => {
	// Store in Postgres and Redis as before

	// Emit Socket.io event
	io.to(channelId).emit("message", message);
};
```

#### Subscribe clients to channels:

- When a client opens a channel, subscribe them to the corresponding Socket.io room. When a message event is received, update the client's state with the new message.

```typescript
// On the client
const socket = io();

const openChannel = (channelId: string) => {
	socket.join(channelId);

	socket.on("message", (message: Message) => {
		// Update state with new message
	});
};
```

#### Unsubscribe clients from channels:

    - When a client closes a channel, unsubscribe them from the corresponding Socket.io room.

```typescript
const closeChannel = (channelId: string) => {
	socket.leave(channelId);
};
```

#### Conclusion:

- These steps should give you a good starting point for managing data flow in your chat system. Remember to adjust them as necessary to fit your specific requirements and constraints.

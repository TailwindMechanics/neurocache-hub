## Study and Understand Layout Design
```md
# 1. Master Flexbox and Grid
> Resources
- Flexbox Froggy: An interactive game to learn Flexbox.
- Grid Garden: An interactive game to learn CSS Grid.
- CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox: A comprehensive guide on Flexbox.
- CSS Tricks Guide to Grid: A comprehensive guide on CSS Grid.
- MDN Flexbox: Mozilla's guide on Flexbox.
- MDN Grid: Mozilla's guide on CSS Grid.

> Implementation
- Understand the concepts, then apply them to small examples.
- Experiment with different layouts to understand how Flexbox and Grid behave in different scenarios.
- Mastering these concepts is key to create responsive designs.

> Acceptance Criteria
- You are able to create a complex layout using Flexbox or Grid.
- You understand how to use Flexbox or Grid to handle responsiveness.
- You have experimented with different layouts and understand the behavior of Flexbox and Grid in different scenarios.

# 2. Ensure Responsiveness
> Resources
- Responsive Web Design Basics: Google's guide to responsive design.
- Media Queries for Standard Devices: A collection of media queries for standard devices.
- Using media queries: Mozilla's guide on using media queries.

> Implementation
- Understand the basic principles of responsive design.
- Get familiar with media queries and how they work. You can test media queries in the browser's developer tools.
- Develop mobile-first: start with a mobile layout, then scale up for larger screens. This approach ensures that your site performs well on smaller, resource-constrained devices.
- Test your designs on various screen sizes using the browser's developer tools or using a tool like Sizzy.
- Introduce Storybook early in the process: it has a built-in tool to simulate different viewport sizes, which makes it easier to develop and test components for various screen sizes.

> Acceptance Criteria
- You understand the basics of responsive design and how to use media queries.
- You can design mobile-first layouts and scale them for larger screens.
- You have tested your designs on various screen sizes and they are adaptable.

# 3. Learn How to Use Debugging Tools
> Resources
- Chrome DevTools Overview: Google's guide to Chrome's built-in developer tools.
- Firefox DevTools Overview: Mozilla's guide to Firefox's built-in developer tools.
- Debugging in Visual Studio Code: A comprehensive guide on debugging in VS Code.
- Breakpoints in JavaScript: Google's guide on using breakpoints for debugging JavaScript.

> Implementation
- Get comfortable with the DevTools in your preferred browser. They're a powerful aid in web development.
- Understand how to use breakpoints to pause the execution of your code. This will allow you to inspect the current state of your app at that point in time.
- Familiarize yourself with the debug features in VS Code. It integrates nicely with Chrome/Firefox and allows you to debug your JavaScript/TypeScript code directly in the editor.

> Acceptance Criteria
- You feel comfortable using the developer tools in your preferred browser.
- You understand how to use breakpoints to debug your JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- You have experience debugging in Visual Studio Code.

## Identify Common Atoms
```md
# Analyze Your Project
- Find common, reusable components within your project. These will serve as your "atoms".

> Acceptance Criteria 
- You have identified the common, reusable components (atoms) in your project.
```

# Get to Know Your Tools
```md
# 1. Research Storybook
- Learn how to use Storybook for component development and documentation.

>  Acceptance Criteria 
- You know how to use Storybook to develop and document your components.

# 2. Research Accessibility
- Study accessibility standards and guidelines, such as WCAG, to ensure your components will be inclusive.

> Acceptance Criteria 
- You understand the basic principles of web accessibility. - You know how to check your components for accessibility issues.

# 3. Understand Testing
- Understand the concepts of unit testing, and learn how to use Jest and React Testing Library.

> Acceptance Criteria 
- You understand what unit testing is and how to write tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

# 4. Familiarize Yourself with Storyshots
-Learn how Storyshots can help in snapshot testing and complement your unit testing strategy.
> Acceptance Criteria 
- You understand how Storyshots can be used for snapshot testing.
